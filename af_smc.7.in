.SH NAME
AF_SMC - Sockets for SMC communication
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/socket.h>
.br
.B "#define AF_SMC 43"
.PP
.I "tcp_socket = socket(AF_SMC, SOCK_STREAM, 0);"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Shared Memory Communication via RDMA
(SMC) is a socket over the RDMA
communication protocol that allows existing TCP socket applications
to transparently benefit from RDMA when exchanging data
over an
.I RDMA over Converged Ethernet
(RoCE) network. Those networks are not routable.
SMC provides
host-to-host direct memory access without traditional TCP/IP
processing overhead.
SMC offers preservation of existing IP topology and IP security, and
introduces minimal administrative and operational changes.
The exploitation of SMC is transparent to TCP sockets applications.
.PP
The new address family
.B AF_SMC
supports the SMC protocol on Linux.
It keeps the address format of AF_INET sockets and supports streaming
socket types only.
.SS Usage modes
Two usage modes are possible:
.IP "AF_SMC native usage"
exploits the socket domain AF_SMC instead of
AF_INET.
.IP "usage of AF_INET socket applications with SMC preload library"
converts AF_INET sockets to AF_SMC sockets.
The SMC preload library is part of the SMC tools package.
.PP
SMC capability of sockets is negotiated during connection setup. If
one peer is not SMC capable, further socket processing falls
back to TCP usage automatically.
.SS Implementation details: Links and Link Groups
To run RDMA traffic to a peer, a so-called
.I link
is established between
a local RoCE card and a remote RoCE card. To enhance availability, you can
configure alternate links with automatic fail over.
Primary and backup links to a certain peer are combined in a so-called
.I link group.
To guarantee untroubled RDMA traffic, the number of connections
per link group and the number of send requests in flight per link are limited.
.SS Enabling SMC
To enable SMC, smc-code must be active: If smc is not part of the
kernel image, load the separate smc module (use "modprobe smc").
.SS RoCE adapter mapping: Creation of a pnet table
The SMC protocol requires grouping of multiple physical networks -
standard Ethernet and RoCE networks. Such groups are called
.I Physical Networks
(PNets). For SMC, RoCE Adapter mapping is configured within a table called
.BR "pnet table" .
Any available Ethernet interface can be combined with available
.I RDMA-capable network interface cards
(RNICs),
if they belong to the same Converged Ethernet fabric.
To configure RoCE Adapter mapping, you must create a pnet table.
Modify the table with the smc-tools command
.I smc_pnet.
.PP
For details call "man smc_pnet".
.SS Important sysctl settings
SMC-R supports IPv4 only. Use this sysctl setting:
.IR  net.ipv6.bindv6only=1
.SS Displaying SMC socket state information
SMC socket state information can be obtained with the smc-tools command
.I smcss.
For details call "man smcss".
.SS Starting a TCP application to work over SMC
To start an existing TCP application to work through SMC, use the SMC
preload library.
The SMC Tools package provides a script called "smc_run"
to convert AF_INET socket calls to AF_SMC socket calls by means of the preload
technique.
.PP
Example:
.IP
smc_run ftp
.PP
This command-line example starts an FTP client over SMC.
.PP
.SS MTU and Infiniband data transfer
Infiniband traffic may use MTU values 256, 512, 1024, 2048, or 4096.
SMC determines the configured MTU size of the RoCE Ethernet port,
announces this MTU size to the peer during connection start, and chooses
the minimum MTU size of both peers.
